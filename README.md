Hi there! I'm kshitij jathar, and I have a passion for creating and organizing programming libraries. Whether it's developing utility-based libraries, writing efficient code, or implementing innovative solutions to make programming tasks easier, I find immense joy in every aspect of software development.

In addition to my love for programming libraries, I enjoy coding in Python and diving into various projects. From small-scale community initiatives to personal tech projects, I'm always on the lookout for new opportunities to learn and grow.
